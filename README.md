# BETER Feed Testing Sandbox (BFTS)

This repository contains a suite of services designed for testing BETER's Feed. The project consists of three main
services:

- **Feed Generator**: An application to launch the playback of prepared test scenarios.
- **Feed Emulator**: An application that emulates BETER's Feed, listens for Feed Consumer connections and delivers
test run's messages generated by the Feed Generator to all Feed Consumer connections.
- **Feed Consumer**: A simple implementation of BETER Feed Consumer, capable of connecting to the Feed and listening
for data. It is primarily utilized as a **testing client** for development purposes rather than for production usage.
