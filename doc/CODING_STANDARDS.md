# Coding Standards for .NET Projects

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices to be followed when contributing to this .NET project. Adhering to these standards ensures consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase.

## General Guidelines

1. **Consistency**: Write code that looks and feels consistent with the rest of the codebase.
2. **Readability**: Prioritize readability over cleverness. Code should be easy to understand.
3. **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to maintain and extend.

## Naming Conventions

1. **Classes and Interfaces**
   - Use PascalCase for class and interface names.
   - Interface names should start with an 'I' (e.g., `IService`, `IRepository`).

2. **Methods and Properties**
   - Use PascalCase for method and property names (e.g., `GetUserById`, `UserName`).

3. **Variables and Parameters**
   - Use camelCase for local variables and method parameters (e.g., `userId`, `userName`).

4. **Constants**
   - Use PascalCase for constants (e.g., `MaxItems`, `DefaultTimeout`).

## Formatting

1. **Indentation**
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

2. **Braces**
   - Place opening braces on the same line as the declaration.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     public class MyClass
     {
         public void MyMethod()
         {
             if (condition)
             {
                 // Do something
             }
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Spacing**
   - Use a single space before and after binary operators (e.g., `a + b`).
   - Use a single blank line to separate logical sections of the code.

## Commenting

1. **Summary Comments**
   - Use XML comments (`///`) for public classes and methods.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     /// <summary>
     /// This method retrieves a user by their ID.
     /// </summary>
     /// <param name="userId">The ID of the user to retrieve.</param>
     /// <returns>The user with the specified ID.</returns>
     public User GetUserById(int userId)
     {
         // Method implementation
     }
     ```

2. **Inline Comments**
   - Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code is not self-explanatory.

## Error Handling

1. **Exceptions**
   - Use exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow.
   - Catch specific exceptions instead of a general `catch (Exception ex)`.

2. **Logging**
   - Log meaningful error messages that provide context and can aid in troubleshooting.

## Code Structure

1. **Classes and Methods**
   - Each class should have a single responsibility.
   - Methods should be small and perform a single task.

2. **Regions**
   - Use `#region` directives to group related pieces of code, but do not overuse them.

## Best Practices

1. **Dependency Injection**
   - Use dependency injection to manage dependencies and improve testability.

2. **Async/Await**
   - Use asynchronous programming (async/await) for I/O-bound operations to improve performance.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Write unit tests for your code to ensure correctness and facilitate refactoring.
